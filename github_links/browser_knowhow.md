# Browser Know How by Links
It's the Internet. So that means even if you like this page's tips or organization... Don't trust anything.

This is a raw list.  If I find something that reasonably is in line with what I want to think about, I note it here.

*However, you should know, even if I just read through for validation of approaches I am taking, I don't use the code I find (i.e., what fun would that be).*

**So beware, I'm the type that will buy a Camel book (for your Perl fans) and it was just for half of a chapter, but by itself was a handy reference.**
